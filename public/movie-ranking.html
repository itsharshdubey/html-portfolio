<h1>The Best Movies According to Harsh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ghajini</h3>
<p>In this movie, Aamir Khan has done his best.</p>
<h3>Chandni Chowk To China</h3>
<p>Instead of facing so many problems, Siddhu (the role played by Akshay Kumar) always was very cheerful. </p>
<h3>Hera Pheri</h3>
<p>A good story and well-played by all the actors.</p>
